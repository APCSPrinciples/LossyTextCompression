# Lossy Text Compression and File Formats
First, find a partner and go to the [Lossy Text Compression Widget](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/hxXJIEGg2yza_Q7t9W04xg).
Discuss the following questions:
+ What is happening in the app?
+ Should this “count” as text compression? Why or why not?
+ What do you think “lossy” refers to?
 
 
With a partner (or by yourself) fill in one row of [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2pWa-RBS3ZbBg7Z_zfjeh2XqMK8xvRTTefSqz7vchI/edit). We'll fill in the complete worksheet in class and discuss the different types of file compression.   
 
Now sign in to code.org and try the [File Formats Matching Puzzle](https://studio.code.org/s/csp2/stage/5/puzzle/2) and see if you can match formats.   
 
If you have extra time, try the [NPR listening test](http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/06/02/411473508/how-well-can-you-hear-audio-quality). See if you can tell the difference of recording music at different lossy bit rates.
